# Basic HTML, CSS and JS Passenger Counter Example Project

## A straightforward web program called the Passenger Counter App is designed to monitor the number of people riding in a bus, rail, or other type of public transportation. The purpose of this software is to give staff members and transportation operators an effective and user-friendly way to manage and keep track of passenger numbers.


This project is an example that was built along with a Youtube series showing how to create a basic HTML, CSS and JS project. Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

* script tag
* variables
* numbers
* string
* console.log()
* functions
* The DOM
* getElementById()
* innerText
* textContent
